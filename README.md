## Flask Application Design for Smart Time Website

**HTML Files:**

1. **index.html**:
   - Main page of the website.
   - Contains a form for users to input tasks and available time slots.
   - Submits the inputs to the Flask backend for schedule generation.

2. **schedule.html**:
   - Displays the generated schedule.
   - Provides a visually appealing representation of the user's planned day.

**Routes:**

1. **home**:
   - Renders the index.html page.

2. **generate_schedule**:
   - Receives the input data from the index.html form.
   - Calls the Smart Time algorithm to generate the schedule.
   - Renders the schedule.html page with the generated schedule.

**Flask Application Structure:**

```
app.py
/templates
    - index.html
    - schedule.html
```

**Smart Time Algorithm Integration:**

The Smart Time algorithm is integrated into the Flask application through the `generate_schedule` route. This route calls a function that implements the algorithm to create the schedule based on the input data.

**Additional Features (Optional):**

* Task reminders can be implemented using a Flask extension like `Flask-APScheduler`.
* Progress tracking can be added by storing task completion status in a database or using a Flask extension like `Flask-User`.

**Benefits for Users:**

* **Improved Productivity and Efficiency:** Automated schedule generation optimizes time usage, allowing users to complete more tasks efficiently.
* **Reduced Stress and Overwhelm:** The structured schedule provides a clear plan for the day, reducing feelings of stress and uncertainty.
* **Improved Work-Life Balance:** By optimizing time management, Smart Time helps users set boundaries and avoid overwork.
